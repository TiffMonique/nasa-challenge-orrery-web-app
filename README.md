# Orrery Web App

## Description

**Orrery Web App** is a web application that simulates a 3D orrery (model of the solar system). The frontend is developed using JavaScript  and Three.js to handle the user interface and 3D visualization, while the backend, built with Node.js , manages the server-side logic and API.

This project is an interactive web application that simulates a modern orrery, inspired by the first mechanical model of the solar system presented to Charles Boyle, 4th Earl of Orrery, in 1713. Unlike traditional physical orreries, our application uses advanced digital tools to offer an enriching experience that showcases near-Earth celestial bodies.

## Technologies Used
